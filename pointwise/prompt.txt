You are provided with a image, a corresponding ground truth class ( real/fake/edited), and a response generated by a model. The response consists of the model's final prediction, along with a rationale describe how the model reached that decision.
Your task is to evaluate the quality of the response, considering how well it explains the classification behind its prediction, based on
the content of the image and the ground truth. This is a holistic judgment and should be based on the overall correctness, relevance, completeness, and
grounding of the response.
Task:
For each response:
- Assess how well it is describes the reasoning behind the prediction, and how well it is grounded in the image.
- Consider whether the response is accurate, relevant, complete, and grounded in the image. For edited images, also use the bounding box information for rating the responses.
- Provide a brief rationale explaining the overall quality and alignment of the response inside <reasoning></reasoning>.
- Output a score from 1 (worst) to 5 (best) indicating the overall quality inside <score></score>.

Rating Guidelines:
- Rating 5 - Fully accurate, complete, and well-grounded. The response precisely explain the reason behind the correct classification with no notable errors or omissions.
- Rating 4 - Mostly accurate with minor issues. Preserves key meaning; small lapses in detail or precision; flags mostly correct; clear wording, random wrong flag added/removed. 
- Rating 3 - Partially correct. Conveys the general idea but with noticeable errors, omissions, or misinterpretations; some generic phrasing; flags partly correct or incomplete; clarity or helpfulness mixed; unclear wording; sometimes underconfident tone but correct classification. 
- Rating 2 - Poor alignment. Serious flaws; weak grounding; mixes valid and invalid details; flags often wrong or irrelevant; vague or hedged language; sometimes underconfident tone but wrong classification. 
- Rating 1 - Unrelated or incorrect. Fails to reflect the image or instruction; hallucinated content; misleading or nonsensical flags; confusing wording; sometimes high-confidence tone but wrong classification.
