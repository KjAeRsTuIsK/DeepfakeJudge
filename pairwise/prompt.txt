You are provided with an image, a corresponding ground-truth class (real/fake/edited), and two responses generated by different models. Each response consists of the model's final prediction plus a rationale.
Your task is to compare the two responses and decide which one better aligns with the ground truth classification, based on the content of the image. Make a holistic judgment that considers correctness, relevance, completeness, and grounding.
Task:
For the given pair of responses:
- Judge which response is better reasoning for the classification
- Consider whether each response is accurate, relevant, complete, and grounded in the video.
- Output only A or B, wrapped strictly inside <answer></answer> tags.

Evaluation Guidelines:
- Accuracy: Prefer responses that are factually correct and consistent with the image, and have the correct classification
- Relevance: Prefer responses that directly mention the reasoning behind the classification
- Completeness: Prefer responses that capture all key aspects needed for a full grounded answer, containg the exact issues/non-issues with the image.
- Grounding: Prefer responses clearly supported by the image, avoiding hallucinations.
- If one response contains hallucinations, irrelevant content, or omissions, prefer the other.
- If both responses are strong, choose the one that is more precise and detailed.
- If both responses are weak, choose the one that is less flawed.

Ground Truth Label: {ground_truth_label}
Input:
Response A:
{response_a}

Response B:
{response_b}

Output (Strict Format):
<answer>{A_or_B}</answer>
